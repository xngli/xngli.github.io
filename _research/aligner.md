<h1>Description</h1>
A high-resolution desktop aligner for multilayer soft lithography was developed that is capable of aligning PDMS sample of varying sizes. By incorporating two microscopes on our platform, the aligner is capable of aligning samples up to 4 inch in diameter. The accuracy of the aligners is quantified by predefined square alignment markers, yielding a result of 10 Î¼m/mm. The aligner was designed to be low cost, light weight, and portable, so that it can be readily accessible to researchers and functional on normal lab benches. The aligner can be used for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices as well as other MEMS devices.
