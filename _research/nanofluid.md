<h1>Description</h1>
Material properties at the nanoscale is difficult to study using experimental approaches, but can be easily done by numerical simulation. Here the static and dynamic properties of nanofluid are investigated using molecular dynamics simulation, including the contact angle, bubble formation, and boundary slip. In all these phenomena, the property of solid surface plays a determinant role due to the large surface/volume ratio in nanoscale.
