Hi, I'm Sean.

Born in Hubei, China, influenced by Beijing, now I live in Ann Arbor. Alumni of Peking University, now attending University of Michigan.

I'm a fourth year PhD student in mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan. As a member of the Integrated Biosystems and Biomechanics Laboratory, my current research interest is to develop 3D cell culture platform for large-scale drug screening.
